This is as best of a walk through as I can make for the Witch_House set up
Which House was designed on Pop OS. If you are not on gnome I may not be able to help you.

You will need these applications.
  Gnome extension manager (I believe this is available in the pop shop)
    https://extensions.gnome.org/
  Gnome Tweaks (I believe this is available in the pop shop)
    https://itsfoss.com/gnome-tweak-tool/
    https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Tweaks?action=show&%3Bredirect=Apps%2FGnomeTweakTool
  Pywal
    https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal
  Conky
    https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky
    https://itsfoss.com/conky-gui-ubuntu-1304/
      the conky config file is in the repo along with the font and backgrounds.
  If you use Firefox or Librewolf I recomend using Firefox Color to theme the browser
    https://color.firefox.com/

The gnome extensions you will need are:
  ArcMenu
  BackSlide
  Blur my Shell
  Color Picker
  Dash to Panel
  Just Perfection
  Rounded Corners
  User Themes
  Vitals
  --On Pop OS you may need to disable "Cosmic Dock" in gnome extensions

You will need to install Themes, Icons and a cursor.
Here is how:

Here are the Themes, Icons and cursor:
  Sunrise GTK Dark Theme:

  Buuf For Many Desktops

  Bibata Modern Amber
    https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1914819

I use alacritty as my terminal. I love it its great to learn on and there are tons of folks who cover alacritty config files.
My terminal theme is made with Pywal. The pywal command I used is:

wal --theme base16-gruvbox-hard -b "120e0d"

This sets the terminal theme without changing the background photo. It sets the terminal back ground color to #120e0d. The rest of the color theme is a gruvbox theme.

vscodium or vscode has a pywal extension called Wal Theme. This will match your vscodium or vscode theme to your terminal.

I turn Window Titles off system wide and use gestures to full screen, minimize or close windows.
this is not something i feel particularly comfortable sharing as i don't understand it enough to prevent people from causing problems for themselves.


I will work on this more overtime and continue to provide more details on settings and options. let me know if you have questions and i will do my best to answer.
Have fun!!
